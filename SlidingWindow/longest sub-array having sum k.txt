This is a variable sliding window problem.
For handling negative value we will use hash table.


def lenOfLongSubarr(arr, n, k):
 
    # dictionary mydict implemented
    # as hash map
    mydict = dict()
 
    # Initialize sum and maxLen with 0
    sum = 0
    maxLen = 0
 
    # traverse the given array
    for i in range(n):
 
        # accumulate the sum
        sum += arr[i]
 
        # when subArray starts from index '0'
        if (sum == k):
            maxLen = i + 1
 
        # check if 'sum-k' is present in
        # mydict or not
        elif (sum - k) in mydict:
            maxLen = max(maxLen, i - mydict[sum - k])
 
        # if sum is not present in dictionary
        # push it in the dictionary with its index
        if sum not in mydict:
            mydict[sum] = i
 
    return maxLen
